# Goal of the Analysis

# Data Preparation:

**Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensure the dataset is free of inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers to improve model accuracy.

**Feature Engineering:** Transform or create features to enhance model performance.

**Data Splitting:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the data, understanding relationships and distributions that might influence model selection and performance.

**Model Training: Selection of Models:** Choose a diverse set of models to compare. This might include decision trees, random forest and XGboost

# Model Evaluation and Comparison:

**Evaluation Metrics:** Utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,to assess each model's performance.

**Predictive Performance:** Determine which model performs best on the test data based on the chosen evaluation metrics.

**Insights and Conclusion:** Draw conclusions from the model comparisons and provide insights into which models are most effective for predicting heart disease in this specific dataset.

# About the Dataset

The UCI Heart Disease dataset comprises a series of attributes designed to forecast the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. Each record in this dataset corresponds to a distinct patient, with the columns detailing diverse health-related characteristics and the presence or absence of heart disease.
